# SecFields - Cybersecurity Grassfileds Booklet

Welcome to SecFields - a comprehensive cybersecurity framework specifically designed for financial institutions. This interactive guide explores the critical security domains required for banking operations including Governance & Strategy, Risk Management, Compliance, Fraud Prevention, and operational security.

## About This Project

This interactive framework aims to provide comprehensive information about cybersecurity domains specifically tailored for financial institutions. The modular system allows for easy expansion of content while maintaining focus on banking-specific requirements and regulatory compliance.

**Complete Banking Security Domains:**

1. **Governance & Strategy**: High-level direction, ownership, and structure including security strategy, organizational structure, and board reporting
2. **Risk Management**: How banks identify and handle cyber risk with quantification, enterprise risk mapping, and scenario modeling
3. **Compliance, Audit & Regulatory**: Regulatory obligations, internal/external audits, and continuous compliance monitoring
4. **Security Architecture**: Designing the bank's security foundation with zero trust, identity architecture, and network segmentation
5. **Security Engineering**: Building security into systems with SSDLC, secure coding, and infrastructure hardening
6. **Identity & Access Management**: Critical IAM controls for financial institutions with privileged access and customer identity
7. **Red Team / Offensive Security**: Organizational penetration testing, threat emulation, and vulnerability management
8. **Blue Team / Detection & Response**: Operational defense with SOC operations, threat hunting, and incident response
9. **Threat Intelligence**: Understanding threats specific to banking with actor tracking and fraud pattern analysis
10. **Cloud & Infrastructure Security**: Bank-specific cloud guardrails and hybrid architecture controls
11. **Endpoint & Device Security**: Covers staff, branch networks, ATMs, and mobile device management
12. **Data Security**: Critical data protection with classification, encryption, and customer data handling
13. **Network Security**: Core protection layer with segmentation and secure connectivity
14. **Fraud & Cyber-Fraud Security**: Bank-specific fraud detection and prevention mechanisms
15. **Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery**: Ensuring the bank keeps running during disruptions
16. **Physical & Operational Security**: Branch operations and insider threat programs
17. **Customer-Facing Security**: Protecting customers through secure online banking and transaction security
18. **Metrics & Reporting**: How banks measure and drive security through KPIs and executive reporting

## Modular Framework

This repository uses a modular framework that allows for easy expansion of banking security content. The system separates the user interface from the content, making it simple to add new banking-specific topics by creating individual module files.

- **Modular Version**: `index.html` - Dynamic content loading system (primary file)
- **Content Modules**: `modules/` - Individual content files that can be easily added or removed
- **Banking Focus**: All content is tailored specifically for financial institution requirements

## How to Navigate

The guide is organized into numbered security domains that you can access through the navigation menu. Each section contains detailed information about the specific banking cybersecurity domain, including:

- Domain-specific strategies and requirements
- Banking industry tools and techniques
- Regulatory compliance considerations
- Implementation guidance for financial institutions
