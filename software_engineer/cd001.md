Deliverables  
1. Monorepo structure in `./xbitcamp` (apps/web, packages/ui, packages/db, packages/api)  
2. Clean, typed code with ESLint + Prettier + Husky pre-commit hooks  
3. README with setup steps, env template, and seed script for demo data (3 courses, 2 instructors, 10 students)  
4. Automated CI via GitHub Actions (lint, test, build)  
5. `pnpm dev` starts everything locally (db, s3 mock, stripe listen)

Style & UX  
- Modern, playful design (use lime & slate palette)  
- Accessible (WCAG 2.1), keyboard navigable, prefers-reduced-motion respected  
- Optimistic UI updates, skeleton loaders, graceful error boundaries  
- Lottie animations for empty states and loading spinners  

Write every file needed, including `.env.example`, SQL seed, and Storybook stories for key UI components.
