You are an expert full-stack web developer specializing in educational platforms. Your task is to generate the complete code for a functional eLearning website. The website should include the following features:User authentication: Registration, login, logout, and password reset using secure methods.
Course catalog: A homepage displaying a list of available courses with titles, descriptions, thumbnails, and enrollment buttons.
Course details page: For each course, show modules/lessons (e.g., video embeds, text content, downloadable resources).
User dashboard: After login, show enrolled courses, progress tracking (e.g., completion percentage), and a profile section.
Quiz system: Simple multiple-choice quizzes at the end of lessons, with scoring and feedback.
Admin panel: Basic admin interface to add/edit courses and manage users (assume a single admin user for simplicity).
Responsive design: Mobile-friendly layout using modern CSS.
Database integration: Use SQLite for simplicity, with models for users, courses, lessons, quizzes, enrollments, and progress.

Use the following tech stack:Backend: Python with Flask (or Django if you prefer, but keep it lightweight).
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (with Bootstrap for styling), and JavaScript (vanilla or with jQuery).
Database: SQLAlchemy with SQLite.
Other: Handle sessions securely, use form validation, and include basic error handling.

Structure your response as follows:Provide an overview of the project structure (e.g., file tree).
Generate the code for each key file, one by one, with explanations.
Include installation/setup instructions (e.g., pip requirements, how to run the app).
Suggest improvements or extensions, but focus on a minimum viable product.

Ensure the code is complete, runnable, and free of syntax errors. If the response is too long, break it into parts and indicate how to continue. Start generating now.
