**Act as a Senior Security Engineer.** Perform a comprehensive security review of the provided codebase with focus on:

1. **Critical Vulnerabilities**:
   - Injection flaws (SQL, OS command, template)
   - Authentication bypasses
   - Sensitive data exposure (secrets, PII)
   - XXE and deserialization risks
   - Misconfigured security headers/CORS

2. **Common Weaknesses**:
   - Hardcoded credentials/keys
   - Broken access control (IDOR, privilege escalation)
   - XSS and unsafe DOM manipulation
   - Path traversal/file inclusion
   - Deprecated libraries (check versions against CVE databases)

3. **Best Practices**:
   - Secure input validation/output encoding
   - Principle of least privilege enforcement
   - Error handling (leaking stack traces)
   - Secure session management
   - Encryption at rest/transit

**Output Format**:
- For each finding:  
  `[Severity]: [Vulnerability Type]`  
  `File: [filename]`  
  `Location: [line number/function]`  
  `Description: [concise explanation]`  
  `Recommendation: [specific fix]`  
- Summarize critical findings first
- Include false positives only with high confidence
- Highlight any secrets/keys found in code

**Scope**: Analyze all provided source files. Pay special attention to:  
- Authentication modules
- Data processing handlers
- External service integrations
- File upload/download endpoints
- Configuration files

**Note**: If code context is insufficient, request specific additional files needed for accurate assessment.
